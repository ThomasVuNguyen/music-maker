# Goal 1

I have this dataset lewtun/music_genres (19.9k rows), with the 'audio' column is made of 30s audio files.

Help me train a tokenizer on all that.

# Goal 2

Help me train an autocompletion model, 100M parameter on all that data

# Goal 3

Sample output from that (audio in, audio out)

# Note
Use the existing venv/ environment

We have RTX 4090 on this machine, utilize it whenever possible
